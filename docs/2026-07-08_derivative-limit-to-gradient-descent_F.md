**Concepts touched:** [[calculus|derivatives & chain rule]] · [[gradient-descent|the training rule]]

**The arc today:** self-study (3B1B Essence of Calculus ch 2–4 + a partial-derivative / gradient
intro), then a depth-gate check where I narrated and got corrected. I kept defaulting to
*approximate* three times; each time we forced it back to *exact*. That pattern **is** the lesson.

## §0 · A line's slope is constant — a curve's is not (why calculus has to exist)

**Cold open:** before you can ask "what's the slope of a *curve*," you have to own the slope of a
**line** — because a line is the one shape whose slope never changes, and that single fact is what
makes the line easy and the curve hard.

### `y = mx + c` — the master recipe for every straight line

```
   y = m·x + c
        │     └─ c = INTERCEPT = the LIFT  → where the line starts (its height at x = 0)
        └─────── m = SLOPE     = the TILT  → how fast it climbs, SAME everywhere = the derivative
```

Two independent knobs, two different jobs — **the tilt and the lift never touch each other.**

### The four cases, side by side  ^line-vs-curve

| equation | m (tilt) | c (lift) | derivative `dy/dx` | a line? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `y = 2x` | 2 | 0 | **2** (constant) | yes — through the origin |
| `y = 3x` | 3 | 0 | **3** (constant) | yes — steeper, still origin |
| `y = 5x + 7` | 5 | 7 | **5** (constant) | yes — lifted 7 off the floor |
| `y = x²` | — | — | **2x** (CHANGES) | **no** — a curve |

- `y = 2x` and `y = 3x` are just `mx + c` with `c = 0` → both launch from the origin; 3 climbs
  faster than 2. Their slope is `m` itself — one number, true at x=1, at x=100, forever.
- `y = x²` is **not** `mx + c`. There's no single `m` to write down, because its slope is
  **different at every point** — its derivative is `2x`, a *formula*, not a number (x=1→2, x=3→6).

### What the `+7` does — and what it does NOT do

Start at 7, add the slope (5) each step — the lift sets the launchpad, the tilt flies the plane:

```
   x:   0     1     2     3
   y:   7    12    17    22
        └──5──┘──5──┘──5──┘     ← every step +5, forever  (the tilt)
        ↑ start at 7             (the lift)
```

> ⚠️ **The slip I hit:** I said "from 7 it moves by 35." The 5 and the 7 **don't multiply** —
> that's fusing the tilt with the lift, two things that never touch. Per step y rises by **5**,
> not 35. And when you differentiate, **the +7 vanishes**: a constant has zero slope, so the lift
> can't affect the tilt. `d/dx (5x + 7) = 5`.

**The punchline that sets up the whole session:** a line's derivative is a *constant* (`m`) — read
it straight off the equation, no zooming needed. A curve's derivative is a *function* (`2x`) — a
different slope hiding at every point — so you must zoom into ONE point to pin it down. **That zoom
is the limit, and the limit is §1.**

---

## §1 · The derivative is the LIMIT (not the approximation)

**Cold open:** §0 leaves us here — a line's slope is one constant number, a curve's changes at
every point, so "the slope of a curve" is ill-posed until you name a point. Two points give you the
slope of the line *between* them (the **secant** = an average), not the slope *at* a point (the
**tangent**). Zoom in until the curve looks pixelated-straight, and the tangent appears.

```
 y│           ,Q          secant P→Q = AVERAGE slope over the gap (an APPROXIMATION)
  │        ,·ˊ ╱
  │     ,·ˊ  ╱
  │  ,·˟P───╱────── tangent at P = the DERIVATIVE (Q slid onto P)
  │,·ˊ
  └─────────────── x
```

**The keystone: the derivative is the value the ratio *approaches* as the nudge shrinks to zero —
the LIMIT — and it is exact.** The measured 2.1, 2.01, 2.001 are *approximations*; the number they
chase is the derivative.

### The anchor numbers — `f(x)=x²` at `x=1`  ^limit-table

```
 nudge dx │  (f(1+dx) − f(1)) / dx           │ ratio
──────────┼──────────────────────────────────┼───────
   0.1    │  (1.21   − 1)/0.1   = 0.21/0.1    │ 2.1
   0.01   │  (1.0201 − 1)/0.01  = 0.0201/0.01 │ 2.01
   0.001  │  …                               │ 2.001
   0.0001 │  …                               │ 2.0001   → homing in on ● 2
```

Two different axes, do not confuse them: the **nudge → 0**, the **slope → 2**. (A parabola is not
flat at x=1, so its slope cannot be heading to 0.)

### Why we can't just set the nudge to 0 — and the trick that saves it

Set `dx = 0` directly and you get `0/0`, which is **indeterminate** (not infinite — that's `1/0`).
The escape is algebra *first*, limit *second*:

```
Step 1 — CANCEL first          Step 2 — THEN send dx → 0
  (2x·dx + dx²) / dx             2x + dx  →  2x        (the +dx becomes EXACTLY 0)
  = dx(2x + dx) / dx
  = 2x + dx                     at x=1 → the derivative is exactly 2
```

Keep `dx` alive so you're *allowed* to cancel it (legal only because `dx ≠ 0`), then send it to
zero at the very end. The **cancellation** — not the smallness — is what escapes the `0/0`.
"Very small" only ever gives 2.0001; the limit gives exactly 2.

### Numpy twin — watch the ratio home in on 2

```python
import numpy as np, matplotlib.pyplot as plt
f  = lambda x: x**2
x0 = 1.0
dxs    = np.array([1, 0.5, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 1e-4, 1e-5])
ratios = (f(x0 + dxs) - f(x0)) / dxs          # the approximations
plt.axhline(2, color='green', ls='--', label='the LIMIT = derivative = 2')
plt.plot(dxs, ratios, 'o-', label='(f(1+dx) − f(1)) / dx')
plt.xscale('log'); plt.xlabel('nudge dx  (→ 0 toward the left)')
plt.ylabel('measured slope'); plt.legend(); plt.grid(True, alpha=.3); plt.show()
for dx, r in zip(dxs, ratios):
    print(f'dx = {dx:<8g}  ratio = {r:.6f}')  # 3, 2.5, 2.1, 2.01 ... → 2
```

---

## §2 · The chain rule multiplies because rates are nested "per" counts

**Cold open:** functions nest — `x → u → y`. A nudge in `x` pokes `u`, which pokes `y`. The two
link-rates **multiply**: `dy/dx = dy/du · du/dx`. The question is *why multiply, not add*.

### The picture — nested containers  ^pizza

```
   1 box ──► 3 pizzas ──► 8 slices per pizza     slices per box = 8 × 3 = 24
```

Not `3 + 8 = 11`. Each of the 3 pizzas brings its **own** 8 slices — **3 groups of 8**, not 3
*plus* 8. A derivative is just a **"per" rate** ("how many of the next thing per one of this
thing"); chaining "per" rates multiplies the group-sizes:

```
   pizzas per box   = 3    ← du/dx
   slices per pizza = 8    ← dy/du
   slices per box   = 8 × 3 = 24   ← dy/dx
```

**Pure-math twin (no toppings):** hours → minutes → seconds = `60 × 60 = 3600` sec/hour. Adding
would say an hour is 120 seconds — an hour of your life says no.

**The absurd check that kills the add-instinct:** ten `×1` gears in a chain give `1×1×…= 1`
(unchanged), not `1+1+…= 10`. Multiply is right; add is nonsense.

> ⚠️ **The trap I hit:** I first "explained" the chain rule as *"the du's cancel."* That's the
> **mnemonic, not the mechanism** — and it strands you the moment the `du`'s don't line up
> (partial derivatives, matrices). The real why is the nested-groups picture above.

---

## §3 · The training gradient `2(P−T)·x` = error × input

Now aim the chain rule at a loss. The chain that matters for training:

```
   weight w ──► prediction P=w·x ──► error e=(P−T) ──► loss L=e²
```

Training asks one question: *"if I nudge `w`, how does the loss `L` move?"* = `dL/dw`. Walk the
chain, multiply the three link-rates:

```
   dL/dw =  dL/de   ·  de/dP  ·  dP/dw
        =  2(P−T)   ·   1     ·   x     =  2(P−T)·x
```

Each link, decoded:
- `dP/dw = x` — nudging `w` moves `P` by `x` (since `P = w·x`, `x` fixed).
- `de/dP = 1` — error `e = P − T`; the constant `T` just **shifts** the curve, never **tilts**
  it, so it contributes 0 to the rate. (Derivative of any constant = 0.)
- `dL/de = 2e = 2(P−T)` — power rule on `L = e²`.

**The two meaningful pieces do two different jobs:**

```
   dL/dw  =   2 · (P − T) · x
                  └──┬──┘   └─ WHICH INPUT is to blame  (credit assignment)
                     └────── HOW WRONG & which way      (the error signal)
```

---

## §4 · One gradient-descent step — the thermostat + the blame

**The rule:** `w ← w − λ · dL/dw`. The **minus** means we step **opposite** the gradient — the
gradient points *uphill* (toward more loss); we want less, so we go the other way.

### Worked example — a pizza-party predictor  ^pizza-step

One knob `w` = "pizzas per guest". True appetite = **1.5 pizzas/guest**.

```
   input       x = 2 guests
   weight      w = 1            (naïve: one whole pizza each)
   prediction  P = w·x = 1×2 = 2 pizzas
   truth       T = 3            (they demolished three)
   error       P − T = 2 − 3 = −1        (negative = ordered too FEW)
   gradient    2·(−1)·2 = −4
   update      w ← 1 − 0.1·(−4) = 1 + 0.4 = 1.4   (λ = 0.1)
   next time   P = 1.4×2 = 2.8   → creeping toward 3 ✓
```

- **Direction (the thermostat 🌡️):** error negative (too few) → gradient negative →
  `w − (negative)` pushes the knob **UP** → order more. Too cold, heat up; too hot, cool down.
  It always shoves the prediction toward the truth.
- **Blame (the input `x`):** the `−4` is `2·(−1)·2`; that last `2` is `x`. A louder input earns a
  bigger correction, because via `P = w·x` a loud input gives that weight a bigger say in the
  answer — so a bigger share of the mistake.

## §5 · The what-if tables (nudge one number, watch the step)

The whole point of `2(P−T)·x` and `w ← w − λ·g` is that every lever has a *predictable* effect.
Base case throughout: pizza-party, `x = 2`, `w = 1` → `P = 2`, `λ = 0.1`.

### Table A · vary the TRUTH `T` (how hungry the crowd is) — the SIGN behaviour

| truth `T` | error `P−T` | gradient `2·err·x` | `w ← w − λg` | reading |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `T = 3` (hungry) | `−1` | `−4` | `1.0 − 0.1·(−4)` = **1.4 ↑** | ordered too few → bump the knob UP |
| `T = 2` (spot on) | `0` | `0` | **1.0** (frozen) | perfect prediction → don't touch it |
| `T = 1` (light eaters) | `+1` | `+4` | `1.0 − 0.1·(4)` = **0.6 ↓** | ordered too many → cut the knob DOWN |

**Read it:** the error's sign is the steering wheel. `T` above → step up, `T` below → step down,
`T` equal → the weight stops moving (that's what *converged* means: zero error → zero gradient).

### Table B · vary the INPUT `x` (loud vs quiet sensor) — credit assignment

Hold the error fixed at `−1` so only `x` changes the story.

| input `x` | gradient `2·(−1)·x` | step `−λg` (λ=0.1) | reading |
|---|---|---|---|
| `x = 0.5` (quiet) | `−1` | `+0.05` | barely nudged — this knob hardly mattered |
| `x = 2` | `−4` | `+0.40` | moderate correction |
| `x = 10` (loud) | `−20` | `+2.00` | slammed hard — this knob drove the answer |

**Read it:** same mistake, correction scales with `x`. A silent input (`x = 0`) → gradient 0 →
weight **untouched** — no `if(asleep) skip`, the math zeroes the blame for free.

### Table C · vary the LEARNING RATE `λ` (stride length) — speed vs overshoot

Hold `g = −4` (the base error). True target `w = 1.5`.

| `λ` | step `−λg` | new `w` | reading |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0.01` | `+0.04` | `1.04` | tiny crawl — safe but slow |
| `0.1` | `+0.40` | `1.40` | healthy step toward 1.5 |
| `0.5` | `+2.00` | `3.00` | **overshoots past 1.5** → next step flips sign → oscillation |

**Read it:** `λ` too small = forever; too big = leap past the bottom and bounce. The decision
boundary of the stride.

### Table D · vary the NUDGE `dx` (from §1) — approximation → exact

| nudge `dx` | ratio `(f(1+dx)−f(1))/dx` | reading |
|---|---|---|
| `1` | `3.0` | crude — a wide secant |
| `0.1` | `2.1` | closer |
| `0.01` | `2.01` | closer still |
| `→ 0` (limit) | **`2` (exact)** | the derivative — after cancelling, not after shrinking |

## §6 · Numpy twin — the pizza knob learns

```python
import numpy as np, matplotlib.pyplot as plt
x, T, w, lr = 2.0, 3.0, 1.0, 0.1        # 2 guests, they ate 3, start naive, small step
hist = []
for step in range(15):
    P = w * x
    grad = 2 * (P - T) * x
    w -= lr * grad                       # step DOWNHILL (minus the gradient)
    hist.append(w)
plt.axhline(1.5, ls='--', color='green', label='true appetite = 1.5 pizzas/guest')
plt.plot(hist, 'o-', label='w (what the model believes)')
plt.xlabel('training step'); plt.ylabel('pizzas per guest'); plt.legend(); plt.grid(alpha=.3); plt.show()
print('final w =', round(w, 4), '  final prediction =', round(w*x, 4))   # → 1.5 , → 3
```

`w` climbs **up** to 1.5 (it started too low, so the fix pushes it up), and the prediction settles
on 3. Change `T` to 1 and it descends to 0.5 instead — Table A, live.

---

## §7 · One knob → many: partial derivatives & the gradient vector  *(added 2026-07-09)*

**Cold open — the StatQuest reconciliation.** The video optimized a *line's* slope and intercept to
fit data points (linear regression); our example tuned a *weight* to predict a temperature. They
felt like two different worlds. They are **the same machine in two costumes** — gradient descent is
a general optimizer; fitting a line and forecasting a temperature are just two things you aim it at.

### Same rows, different labels  ^lr-map

| StatQuest (linear regression) | Our thermal / pizza example | what it is |
|---|---|---|
| `y = m·x + c` | `P = w·x + b` | the model (a line) |
| x = body weight | x = sensor reading / guests | the INPUT |
| y = predicted height | P = predicted temp / pizzas | the PREDICTION |
| actual height (the dot) | T (measured temp / plates eaten) | the TRUTH |
| residual = actual − predicted | error = (P − T) | how wrong (sign flipped, same thing) |
| SSR = Σ residual² | L = (P − T)² | the LOSS |
| m (slope), c (intercept) | w (weight), b (bias) | the KNOBS |
| ∂SSR/∂m , ∂SSR/∂c | ∂L/∂w , ∂L/∂b | the GRADIENT |

`y = mx + c` **is** `P = wx + b`: **slope = weight, intercept = bias.** Same algebra, different jargon.

> ⚠️ **Landmine — "weight" is overloaded.** In the video the x-axis "weight" is a person's *body
> weight* = the INPUT. In ML, "weight" = the tunable *knob* = the slope. Same word, opposite jobs.

### Partial derivative = freeze every knob but one

The video froze the slope at 0.64 and wiggled ONLY the intercept to draw its U-curve. That
freeze-all-but-one IS the definition of a **partial derivative** (`∂`).

**Why freeze? The shower of death. 🚿** Two taps, hot + cold. To measure the hot tap's effect alone
you hold cold dead still and wiggle only hot — crank both, get scalded, and learn nothing (you
can't tell which tap did it). Firmware twin: change ONE register at a time or you don't know which
caused the bug. One variable at a time, or the experiment is garbage.

### The geometry — the loss is a BOWL, freezing = a slice

The loss isn't a U-curve; it's a **bowl** over a floor with two axes (weight × bias):

```
        L (error, up)
          │      ___
          │    _/   \_        ← the full bowl: floor = (weight, bias)
          │   /   ●   \       ● = the bottom (best w AND best b together)
          │  /____|____\
   weight ┼───────┼─────── bias
                  |
   freeze weight  →  slice straight down along bias  →  that ONE slice is a clean U-curve,
                     an honest single-variable derivative (the §1 machine)
```

Freeze one knob = take a 1-D **slice** through the bowl; on that slice only one variable moves, so
it's an ordinary derivative. Don't freeze, and you're wandering the 2-D surface — "the slope" stops
meaning anything.

### The two partials for our model

```
   freeze b, wiggle w  →  ∂L/∂w = 2(P−T)·x      error × INPUT
   freeze w, wiggle b  →  ∂L/∂b = 2(P−T)·1      error × 1   (b's coefficient is 1 — no input attached)
```

**The tell:** the weight's gradient carries an `x`; the bias's does not. So the **weight** reacts to
the *input* (loud sensor → big correction — credit assignment), while the **bias** absorbs the *raw*
leftover error, blind to any input. Physically `b` is the **baseline offset** — the prediction when
every input is 0 (the idle/ambient temperature the controller reads at zero load; §0's "lift" now
living inside the model while the weights are the "tilt").

### The sleeping-sensor case — `x = 0`

```
   P = w·0 + b = b            ← prediction collapses to JUST the bias
   ∂L/∂w = 2·err·0 = 0        ← weight FROZEN (asleep sensor earns no blame)
   ∂L/∂b = 2·err  ≠ 0         ← bias still corrects
   error = P − T = b − T      ← true ONLY here: x=0 wiped out w·x; the general case stays P − T
```

### Stack them → the gradient vector

```
   ∇L = [ ∂L/∂w , ∂L/∂b ] = [ 2(P−T)·x , 2(P−T) ]
```

Each partial is one knob's downhill slope; stacked, they're the **compass that points straight
downhill on the whole bowl at once.** Update every knob together: `w ← w − λ·∂L/∂w` and
`b ← b − λ·∂L/∂b`. **That is the one→many jump — from a single derivative to the gradient vector.**

## Decision boundary

- ✅ **Derivative-as-limit** — reach for it whenever "how fast is this changing *right here*". The
  cancel-then-limit method is the honest one; the numerical `(f(x+h)−f(x−h))/2h` is the debug tool.
- ✅ **Chain rule** — any nested "if I nudge this, how does that move" — and it's the *only* tool
  for a composition (every ML gradient is a composition).
- ✅ **`2(P−T)·x` + descent** — differentiable loss, weights to tune.
- ❌ **NOT** a one-shot solver — it's iterative and finds a *local* minimum; tiny linear problems
  belong to closed-form. And `λ` must be tuned (Table C).

## Project brick

This is the literal training engine of the **R1 throttle predictor** and **R2 LSTM forecaster**
([[gradient-descent]] project brick). Read the thermostat in firmware terms: under-predict the
temperature → negative gradient → weights pushed up → predicts hotter next tick → throttles
earlier. The what-if tables are the knobs I'll actually turn when the forecaster mis-calibrates.

**Closed 2026-07-09 (§7):** the one→MANY jump is owned — partial derivatives (freeze-all-but-one),
the two model partials (`∂L/∂w = 2·err·x`, `∂L/∂b = 2·err`), and the gradient vector
`∇L = [∂L/∂w, ∂L/∂b]` as the downhill compass. Reconciled with StatQuest's linear-regression line
fit: **slope = weight, intercept = bias, SSR = the loss** — same machine, two costumes.

---

## Key takeaways

1. The derivative is the **limit** (exact), not the small-nudge **approximation**.
2. `0/0` is **indeterminate**, not infinite — which is *why* a slope can be a clean finite number.
3. **Cancel first, then take the limit** — the cancellation escapes the `0/0`, not the smallness.
4. The chain rule **multiplies** because rates are **nested "per" counts** — not because "du's cancel".
5. `2(P−T)·x` = **error × input**: the error steers the **direction**, the input sets the **blame**.
6. Descent **subtracts** the gradient — step *opposite* the uphill arrow.
7. A **partial derivative** freezes every knob but one → a 1-D slice through the loss **bowl** (an honest single-variable derivative on that slice).
8. **Weight vs bias:** `∂L/∂w = 2·err·x` scales with the input (credit assignment); `∂L/∂b = 2·err` is blind to input — it absorbs the raw error (the baseline offset).
9. **Gradient vector** = stack the partials → the compass pointing straight downhill; linear regression and the thermal predictor are the **same machine** (slope=weight, intercept=bias).
